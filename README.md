## BI4SS Datamining 🔧

At this phase, we have the data in the data warehouse and it's ready for mining, this repository includes all the work that has been established to make the machine learning models and the data mining processes.

## Requirments 🛠

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [conda](https://conda.io/) to install The Requirment Packages.

 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Sklearn
 - Keras
 - Pytorch

## Some Results
Here is a result from mining the data and deducing that the algorithmics subjects are the critical units to obtain in order to be successful in the rest of the curriculum of Computer science:
